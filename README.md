# delegate-server

  

A Delegate server implementation in Python.

[Not finished, not for production purposes as of now]

  

This program will likely not run, so don't even try to. It is in debugging and development mode right now, meaning that the database and various other configurations are tailored specifically for our development team. Aside from that, it is extremely buggy and unpolished.

  

## Phases

  

Due to the nature of Delegate, it is a very large project, especially for its limited number of members actively developing it. For this reason, the development of the Delegate server implementation is broken up into various phases, in order to make the workload manageable.

  

We are currently **in the beginning stages of Phase 2**

  

Phase 1:

- ~~User implementation~~

- ~~User settings~~

- ~~User subscriptions~~

- ~~User Friends~~

- ~~Server constants~~

- ~~Basic server code and connection abstractions~~

- ~~Commands & Command abstractions~~

- ~~Command regulation abstractions~~

- ~~Setting regulation abstractions~~

- ~~User 2FA implementation~~

  

Phase 2:

- Channel implementation

- Subchannel implementation

- Roles & Permissions

- Channels

- Subchannels

- Channel Settings

- Channels

- Subchannels

- User-Channel

- User-Subchannel

Phase 3:

- HTTP endpoints

- Channel & Subchannel webhooks

- Channel querying

- Server querying

- User querying

- Message querying and saving

- Implementation of User and Channel streams

- Code cleanup

- Finalization

- Done (hopefully?)
